# Project 5 (RATING)
This project is all about a web application that users can get information about movies such as rating , directors ,actors, etcâ€¦ 
They can even rate to them or leave comments, even reading other people's comments 
This project is inspired by IMDb and based on it and this is completely different from the project 2 & project 4. Maybe it's not as interactive as them but it's so useful 
Users can find out their favorite movies, watch trailers and create their own watchlit
Even they can recommend them to the others and leave comments

## Models.py
